<h1>Milan Time-Varying Road Network Data and Manipulation Tool</h1>
<p>Welcome! Here you can find a sample time-varying network data and the instructions for manipulating the data. The methodology is presented in &quot;<a href="http://elif.eser.bilkent.edu.tr/roadnetwork/generatingNetwork.pdf
">Generating Time-Varying Road Network Data Using Sparse Trajectories</a>&quot; published in SSTDM 2016. You can cite our paper when you use this data. </p> 
<h2>Instructions and The Data</h2>
<p><strong>1)</strong> You can download the road network data using the following links:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~elif.eser/RoadNetworkFiltered.gdb">Real data based time-varying road network (filtered) </a></li>
  <li><a href="http://cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~elif.eser/RoadNetworkPartialFiltered.gdb">Real data based time-varying road network (partial filtered)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Both data include a time-varying network but with differently generated time-varying weights. The data are kept in Sparksee database format. </p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Before using the database with <a href="http://elif.eser.bilkent.edu.tr/roadnetwork/roadNetwork.jar">the Java API</a> for manipulation of them, you need to visit <a href="http://www.sparsity-technologies.com/#licenses">Sparksee</a> for licenses. There are free licenses for researchers and developers.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong>After getting required license, you are ready to use the provided Java API! Here is the <a href="http://elif.eser.bilkent.edu.tr/roadnetwork/documentation">Documentation</a> of it.
