Milan Time-Varying Road Network Data and Manipulation Tool
Here you can find a sample time-varying network data and the instructions for manipulating the data. The methodology is presented in "Generating Time-Varying Road Network Data Using Sparse Trajectories" published in SSTDM Workshop at ICDM 2016. Please cite our paper when you use this data. 
Instructions and The Data
1) You can download the road network data using the following links:
Real data based syntetic time-varying road network 
Syntetic and real data hyrid time-varying road network
Both data include a time-varying network but with differently generated time-varying weights. The data are kept in Sparksee database format. 
2) Before using the database with the Java API for manipulation of them, you need to visit Sparksee for licenses. There are free licenses for researchers and developers.
3)After getting required license, you are ready to use the provided Java API! Here is the Documentation of it. Also, you can reach the source code via the GitHub repository.
